             Hello! I'm Kerem, a dedicated student of Software Engineering at Atilim University. 
            I'm currently expanding my expertise at the Barcelona Code School, where I'm training to become a full-stack developer. 
            My journey into coding began in 2021 when I started to teach myself programming. 
            Through continuous learning and practical experience, I am working towards mastering the art of building innovative software solutions.
